Things to remember
---------------------------
1.) When you add a function, dont forget to export in the main file
2.) Documentation Docstrings must can't have line spaces between description and function, otherwise text wont show up

---------------------------------
* Functions : MetaLog Distributions
* BP : Use print to List Outputs for use with graph and stats functions
* Create a Percentile reporting function that supports Percentiles, Quantiles, Deciles and quintiles
* BP for Modeling : create functions for all repeated logic
* BP: Correlation has to be done for all groups of simulated vars separately and recombined into sensitivity tables
* Chart: Changes to output means Sensitivity Chart
* Function: Combined Expert Opinion
* Time Series: Learning Curve Forecasts
* Function: Ogive through empirical resampling
* Documentation: Error Messages
* Chart: ADD S-Curve (in Markowitz example)
